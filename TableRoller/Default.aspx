		<p><span class="first">T</span>his is a test site for some RPG utilities and .Net classes I am writing, aimed
		primarily at Dungeons & Dragons. I don't have any grand plan, just to add things slowly as I get ideas. 
		There are plenty of similar utilities on the web. Mine are more of a programming exercise than anything else, 
		but as I go along I do hope to develop some kind of integrated structure that links everything together.
		I like the idea of character generators but mainly for NPCs. Creating your own characters is a fun part 
		of AD&amp;D that I wouldn't want to automate. Likewise with rolling dice. I think automatied dice rollers are
		a great thing to hook up to tools that need randomization, but I wouldn't want to use one as a substitute
		for real dice during game play. Rolling dice is too much fun. </p>
